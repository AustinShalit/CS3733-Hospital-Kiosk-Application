# Prototype Database Application

Using the empty project zip file, write a JavaFX program that demonstrates reading the PrototypeNodes.csv file and creating the embedded database table from it. Then read the data from the table into Java objects. Display the data in a window. In a separate window, permit a user to modify the values. The Java objects and database should then be updated accordingly. In a third window, permit the user to download the updated data into a CSV file. Using Gradle, generate a JAR file. Make sure that the program correctly accesses the database if it is run from a different computer!
